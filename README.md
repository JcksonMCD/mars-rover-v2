# Mars Rover V2

Welcome to the Mars Rover Simulator!

It's your first day at Mission Control, and you need to practice maneuvering the roversâ€”it's tricky stuff! To help, you've been given this state-of-the-art simulator. Choose a plateau size, land one (or more) rovers on the plateau, and feed them movement instructions.

## How to run
Clone this repository to your local machine, run the Main method, and follow the prompts in the console. Happy Rovering! :)
